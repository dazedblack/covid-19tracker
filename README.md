Hi. I just want to try API's and understand to 
how API runs, 
how I can get and handle API data.

Also want to refresh the axios documentation in my brain.

So... I watched some youtube videos.. It was very useful to me.
finally,
I decided to do the Covid19-Turkey Data Visulation with API.
I wanted to pull datas dynamically, but I realized the last datas are null. 
So I pulled constant. But I wrote the dynamic date codes too...

You can see my data visulization project here;
